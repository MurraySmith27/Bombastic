Bombastic is a game I built in 48 hours in C++ and OpenGL!

It was built for the Ubisoft NEXT programming competition in spring 2023.

Features include:
1. A full entity-component system.
2. A working 3D renderer with Blinn-phong shading (diffuse and specular contributions).
3. A full heirarchical game object system.
4. A Scripting framework to attach scripts to game objects.
5. Collision detection and handling.
6. An OBJ importer for 3D meshes.
7. And more!
